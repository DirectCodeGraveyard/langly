# lang-detect

Language Detection Library in Groovy

## Goals
- Powerful
- Efficient
- Simple to Use

## Plan
lang-detect will use multiple methods to detect languages, and will rate the results.

The following methods are planned:
- File Extensions (Matching Filenames to a languages common extensions)
- Syntax (Using [Antlr4](http://www.antlr.org/) and [prewritten grammars](https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4))
- Regular Expression (To match common practices)

To suggest more methods, create a issue with the `method` label on the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/DirectMyFile/lang-detect/issues)
